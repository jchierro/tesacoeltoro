# Tesaco el Toro

## Introduction
Tesaco el Toro is a tongue-in-cheek landing page that showcases an imaginary squad of bull-wrangling specialists. The site combines playful copywriting with bold visuals to tell the story of Rome and the crew who rescue runaway bulls, stage absurd capeas, and throw over-the-top celebrations.

## About the Project
The website presents the brand's services, a gallery of "faenas memorables," team highlights, contact information, and an interactive taurine quiz. Every section leans into the comedic personality of Tesaco el Toro, embracing Spanish-language humor and a fiesta-inspired aesthetic to entertain visitors while explaining the group's extravagant offerings.
